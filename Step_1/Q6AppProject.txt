Throughout my career I have encountered a myriad of processes that could be more 
automated.  Many companies rely on legacy programs and processes that don't rely on 
the increased throughput and productivity of automation.  Below are several application
ideas that would help move an organization towards the advantages of labor saving
technology.

My Budgeting Calculator will use multiple built-in calculators to generate text and 
graphical analytics for common budgeting functions.  Home, car, and credit equations
will be used estimate monthly payments balanced against income and other debt.
A built-in charting function will display the statistics that will allow users to make
informed financial decisions.

* Alt Name:  Home Budgeting Planner
* Main Feature:  Multiple calculators in a single app
* Additional Feature: Alerts when overbudget, connect to Nerdwallet
	
IT Training is becoming mandatory even across non-IT fields.  Some training is standard
but others require certification, continuing education credits, and recertifications.
I would like to develop a training tracker that would help managers ensure that personnel
are trained and up to date.  The tracker would require users and information to be input
into a database.  Control groups of Job billets combined with training requirements will 
be applied to indiviuals or sections input into the database.  Statistical information 
will  be generated that show  retention requirements, deadlines, certificate expirations,
and compliancy/ non-compliancy rates.

* Alt Name: IT Training Compliancy Tracker
* Alt Name: Required Training/ Certification Tracker
* Main Feature: Tracks input personnel who are required to maintain IA Compliance
* Alt Feature: DOD Information Assurance Level Tracker
* Alt Feature: Output Charts for workforce percentage of completion
* Alt Feature: Displays warnings and alerts for personnel not compliant


Task Organization is the quickest way to ensure the time and effort put towards completing a
task or goal is not wasted.  My task organization app would feature tools in common with 
those presented in Microsoft ProjectsÂ© Users will input a task, deadline, and hours needed
for task completion.  The task can then be assigned to a person or a section and automatically
prepare an email alerting that a task has been created for said group.  Some task can be linked
and show dependencies or external group assignments.  The final feature would allow statistics
of task completion to be able to analyze where time is being wasted.

* Alt Name: Task Organizer - Digital Kanban Board
* Alt Name: Trouble-Ticket Database
* Main Feature: Task Tracking and Assignment
* Alt Feature: Outputs statistics and charts for completion analysis
* Alt feature: Auto-generates dialog for emails to disbursed to assigned personnel

These products will be designed to increase productivity in any office or home alike.
They have very few dependancies and can be lightweight enough as to not slow down 
common computer systems, but effective in the task of building an automated workforce.
