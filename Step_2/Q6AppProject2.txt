Throughout my career as an IT, I have encountered a myriad of processes that could be more 
automated.  Many companies rely on spreadsheets to manage elements of personnel training management.
These spreadsheets require a person to update information by hand and commonly never alert
management of delinquencies and deadlines unless manually input.  My application will give
training supervisors a tool the will help teams stay updated with training requirements.  This
application will help others and showcase my coding ability.

There are 3 main areas of data input for the training tracker.  Training is divided into 
two groups - company and industry.  Company is training that is only relevant to the specific
company and is locally produced - like onboarding, annual cyber awareness, or for DOD - annual
operations security training.  The second type of training will be industry.  This type of 
training is primarily outsourced.  Cisco certifications, Defense Aquisition University course
requirements, and teaching certifications...etc.  

The second main group of data input is personnel input.  This list will contain information on
each person's billet, department, email, phone, and other details that will help track the 
employee.  I would like to build an automated system that alerts employees of delinquent training
via email.

The third main group of data input is Company and billet structure.  How the company is pieced 
together helps divide chart and statistics.  50% of the IT Department is not certified to work
on secret equipment.  Knowing billet structure will also help with onboarding new individuals.  
Sarah just started working for HR, so we know that she will need the Company welcome aboard brief
as well as the PII Handling certification.

Programming will consist of several database tables to house certification and personnel information.  The
frontend of the user's GUI will be web based style of entry boxes programmed in c#, while the backend will contain database repositories for information callback.  The certification database will be divided into billet types.  The personnel will be divided by departments.  There will also be a contractor database that lies outside of company parameters.  User will can import information from a .csv file.  Information can also be exported to an excel document for easy reporting and dissemination.  The tracker would require users and information to be input into a database.  Control groups of Job billets combined with training requirements will be applied to indiviuals or sections input into the database.  Statistical information will  be generated that show  retention requirements, deadlines, certificate expirations, and compliancy/ non-compliancy rates.

I will utilize a standard software development cycle, SDLC.  I will identify all of the requirements that 
need to be in my application to ensure automation and productivity are at the forefront of it's development.  Then I will define what each of the attributes require and ensure that a time block is designated for product feasibility and feature lockdown.  The next phase of design will ensure that the methods used to 
generate the application are conducive with expectations and the ability of the coding environment.  This phase will also solidify what each element should appear to the users.  Between coding, testing, and deployment are time blocks set from the defining and design phase to esure a complete product is ready 
for official release and deployment.
